### start?: `number`

Frame at which the animation should start. _Defaults to 0._

:::note Initial values aren't applied before the `start` frame.

- If you want to hide the element before the animation starts, use the `in` prop on the`<Animated>` component to set the in frame for the entire animation.
- If you want the animated property to have a different initial value, you may change it beforehand using your own styling.

:::

### duration?: `number`

Number of frames for which the animation is stretched. Can be set for both spring and bezier easing animations. Defaults to 15 frames for custom easing functions.

### easing?: `EasingBehaviour`

You can provide a custom easing behaviour here instead of the spring properties.
This will override the spring animation. Read more about easing in the [Easing section](/docs/category/easing).
